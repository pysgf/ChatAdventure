ChatAdventure
=============

A clone of a chat client I don't even remember anymore.

Installation
------------

Install pyglet for the client side:
```bash
sudo pip install http://pyglet.googlecode.com/files/pyglet-1.2alpha1.tar.gz
```

Now, just run the server or client:
```bash
python2.7 server.py
python2.7 client.py
```
